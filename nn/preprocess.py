def one_hot_encode_seqs(seq_arr: List[str]) -> ArrayLike:
    """
    This function generates a flattened one hot encoding of a list of nucleic acid sequences
    for use as input into a fully connected neural net.

    Args:
        seq_arr: List[str]
            List of sequences to encode.

    Returns:
        encodings: ArrayLike
            Array of encoded sequences, with each encoding 4x as long as the input sequence
            length due to the one hot encoding scheme for nucleic acids.

            For example, if we encode 
                A -> [1, 0, 0, 0]
                T -> [0, 1, 0, 0]
